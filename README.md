## Excel Plugin for Google's Gemini AI Model

âš¡ Excel Plugin for Google Gemini ðŸ¤– â€” Now with Ultra-Fast Parallel Processing ðŸš€ Custom AI functions right in your spreadsheet. Smarter, faster, better.

Get AI-enriched results in milliseconds over hundreds of cells! Automate and systematize various tasks from freeform text cells such as labelling, classification, keywords extraction, sentiment analysis, etc.

This project is a bring your own keys set of Excel Add-in and user-defined functions (UDF) built for integrating with the Gemini AI models by Google. Google offers free API keys but you can use paid API keys for faster results and keeping your data private, see below for more instructions.

If you want the fastest, most up-to-date experience, use the parallel processing `Gemini_udf_p()` user-defined function, see below for more instructions.

## Google Gemini API key generation

To use this software, you need to input your own Gemini API key.

You can generate Gemini API keys here (as of 2025):

https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

You can generate free API keys, but they are then rate limited (so you will get some cells with a rate limit message instead of the result you want if you are calculating too many cells at once) and Google will collect all the data you send to train on it.

If you want to lift rate limits to process a lot of cells very fast, as well as keeping your data private, out of Google's training dataset, and have no rate limit, you can generate paid API keys on the same page after activating your Google Cloud billing account and have an active payment method. Note that this also allows you to enjoy free services such as the web interface of Google AI Studio for free but still keep your data [out of the training dataset]https://discuss.ai.google.dev/t/google-ai-studio-is-unsafe-for-private-data/78277/7).

Note that the speed of the response depends on whether the model needs to think to process the request, and also the length of the prompt. Usually, a <1k tokens prompt including other cells contents as context does not take more than a few milliseconds to process for hundreds of cells in parallel.

## Instructions for the Excel Add-in

The Excel Add-in is the most feature-rich, but the source code is unfortunately locked behind a password.

For installation and usage, refer to the instructions by clicking on the link below:  
[Instructions Link](https://www.listendata.com/2023/12/integrate-gemini-into-excel.html)

Note that the Add-in was moved to the `addin` folder. The rest of the instructions remain the same.

## Instructions for the user-defined functions (UDFs)

In the `udf` folder, you can find the user-defined function (UDF) version of the `Gemini()` function in the add-in. This is the only function that was implemented in the UDFs, as it is the most general-purpose, all the other functions behaviors can be reproduced with custom prompts enriched with cells data.

There are two versions of the UDFs:

* `Gemini_udf()` which is a very similar function to the add-in, it is likewise sequential and blocking (ie, when the fill handle is used, a calculation starts and each cell is filled one after the other).

* `Gemini_udf_p()` which is a non-blocking parallel processing ready version, which allows to process with parallelism in a non-blocking way, so that it is much faster to work on multiple cells. It is also triggered on-demand via a macro `StartGeminiPoller`, instead of automatically on fill handle activation.

Note: with a paid API key, it is very fast to get charged for a lot of cells with the parallel processing function, since it is very fast as it sends requests in parallel, so be careful to test first on a couple of cells before applying to more than hundreds of cells, otherwise you may have a high bill if you have to run multiple times on thousands of cells because your prompt was not as accurate as you thought. So iterate on your prompt first on a few cells before extending to more to keep the cost in your control.

### How to install the UDF functions

First you need to git clone this repository, do not just download the files, otherwise the line endings will be converted into LF. If you do download the files manually without git clone, then ensure to convert the line endings into CRLF (this can be done in one click with the opensource editor Notepad++).

The functions were tested on Microsoft Office 2016 version 2412 build 18324.20194.

### How to use Gemini_udf (sequential processing UDF)

To use it, you need to import the .blas file as a module in any Excel file where you want to use the function.

1.  Open the **VBA editor** (`Alt + F11`)

2.  Then go to `File > Import File...` and select `Gemini_udf/geminiAI_Excel_udf.bas`

3. In any cell, type `Gemini_udf("Prompt text"&A1;"Gemini_API_key";"Gemini_model")`. The Gemini model is optional, and also a max word count for the response can be added as a 4th optional argument. The cell can be copied into other cells to calculate in batches and with auto incrementing cell reference.

Note that if you make any change to the sourcecode files, you will need to delete the modules in your Excel sheet and import again the files.

### How to use Gemini_udf_p (parallel processing UDF)

To use it, you need to import the .bas and .cls files as modules in any Excel file where you want to use the function.

1.  Open the **VBA editor** (`Alt + F11` -- or on some laptops, you may need to press `Fn + Alt + F11`)
    
2.  Then go to `File > Import File...` and select `Gemini_udf/GeminiAI.bas`. It should be imported under a `Module` folder. NOTE: if you get a #NAME error, make sure this file has CRLF line endings (you need to clone the git repository, you cannot just download the raw file from rawgithub).

3. Do the same with the `Gemini_udf/cGeminiRequest.cls` file, it should be imported under a `Class Module` folder. NOTE: if it gets imported as a simple Module instead of a Class Module (or if you get the error `Expected: instruction end`, then ensure the .cls file has CRLF line returns and not just LF.

4. In any cell, type `Gemini_udf_p("Prompt text"&A1;"Gemini_API_key";"Gemini_model")`. The Gemini model is optional, and also a max word count for the response can be added as a 4th optional argument. The cell should now show "Pending..."

5. Use the fill handle to copy while increasing the counter over a range of cells. All the cells should show "Pending...". Note: if you want to be able to re-run the command, it is now time to make a copy in another cell or in a notebad, because the result will replace the formula.

6. Open the Macros viewer (press `Alt + F8` or `Fn + Alt + F8` on some laptops), then select `StartGeminiPoller`, and tap on the `Execute` button. The cells should now all get filled with their final values after a short time (depending on the the selected AI model latency). Note that the results will replace the formula, so the formula is now lost once the poller is executed and the results are received.

7. Optional: If you want to be able to call the UDF again next time you open the file without having to import again the modules, you can save your worksheet as a `.xslm` file.
